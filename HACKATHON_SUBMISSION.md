## 🎯 What It Is

**VoiceWatch AI** is a voice-driven LLM observability platform that makes monitoring AI applications as simple as having a conversation. Instead of complex dashboards and query languages, developers just ask:

- *"What's the system health?"*
- *"Show me the latency metrics"*
- *"Any critical alerts?"*
